1  alloc             : a simple 8 byte allocation
2  alloc_nospace     : allocation is too big to fit in available space
3  writeable         : write to a chunk from Mem_Alloc and check the value
4  align             : first pointer returned is 8-byte aligned
5  alloc2            : a few allocations in multiples of 4 bytes
6  alloc2_nospace    : second allocation is too big to fit
7  align2            : a few allocations in multiples of 4 bytes checked for alignment
8  alloc3            : many odd sized allocations
9  align3            : many odd sized allocations checked for alignment

10 free2             : a few allocations in multiples of 4 bytes followed by frees
11 free3             : many odd sized allocations and interspersed frees
